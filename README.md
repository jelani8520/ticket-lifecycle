As an end-user,  i create the following ticket  entire mobile/online banking system is down. Opening a new ticket in a ticketing system creates a formal request for support, service, or issue resolution. It allows users (customers or employees) to report problems, ask questions, or request assistance. The ticket is then assigned to the appropriate agent, team, or department based on its category and priority.<img width="1680" alt="Screen Shot 2025-02-17 at 12 10 45 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bea2faa-74e3-46f4-a0da-31b7cd6c0ad7" />

As a Help Desk Agent i observe the ticket’s properties	Priority,Department, SLA ,Assigned To ,Updating the SLA (Service Level Agreement) plan in a ticketing system modifies response and resolution time commitments based on service priorities, customer tiers, or business needs. This ensures that tickets are handled according to the latest support policies, urgency levels, and operational goals.

Adding a new help topic is like creating a new page in a help book or FAQ for a website or app. When people have questions or run into problems, they can check out these topics to find answers on their own instead of having to ask for help. It’s a way to give people the information they need to solve issues faster, without waiting for someone to reply. So, when you add a new help topic, you're basically adding a new guide or tip that makes things easier for everyone</p><img width="1680" alt="Screen Shot 2025-02-17 at 12 24 59 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3fbad4-4980-41e2-ac28-8b998936458f" />
